## Description

Full stack developer with a Bachelor's degree in Communications from Brigham Young University and a recently received Full-Stack Web Development Certification from the University of Richmond, I'm more than capable of taking your project to the next level.

My core strengths include HTML, CSS, Javascript, and responsive web design. For ~4 years, I’ve done freelance work building Wordpress websites for clients on the side—dissecting their problems, and hammering out solutions one project at a time.

After 10 years of digital marketing experience, I made the move over to full stack development so that I could follow my passion for creativity and web technologies, and I’m excited about the opportunities that await.
